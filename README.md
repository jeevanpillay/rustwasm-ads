# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Objective
This repository contains full implementations of algorithms and data structures written in Rust.

The repository should be able to be compiled down to WebAssembly.

## Scope
Heaps and Trees
- Binomial
- Fibonacci
- B-Trees

Linear Pattern Matching
- Gusfield
- Boyer-Moore's
- Ukonnen's

Disjoint-set Data Structures
- Union-Find

Semi-Numerical Algorithms
- Number-theoretic algorithms (Fast integer multiplication)
- Modular exponentiation by squaring
- Miller-Rabin randomized primality testing

Data Compression algorithms
- Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) algorithm and its variant
